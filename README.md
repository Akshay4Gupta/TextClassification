# TextClassification
In this problem, we will use the Naı̈ve Bayes algorithm for classification of tweets by different twitter users.
The dataset for this problem can be obtained from http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students. Given a user’s tweet, task is to predict
the sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral) of the tweet. Read the website for more details about the
dataset. The dataset contains separate training and test files containing 1.6 Million training samples and
498 test samples, respectively.
Q1) Implement the Naı̈ve Bayes algorithm to classify each of the tweets into one of the given
categories. Report the accuracy over the training as well as the test set.
